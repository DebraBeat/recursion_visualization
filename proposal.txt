Project Information

This project is about visualizing recursive functions. This is relevant to
Programming Language Concepts because implementation of recursion uses a number
of these concepts. In particular, Dynamic linking and Associative Arrays.

Language Choice & Justification

This project will use Python and the Manim library for visualization. Python
has been chosen for it's implementation of data structures and the Manim
library. Manim has been chosen for it's powerful visualization capabilities and
ease of use.

Problem Definition and Objectives

This project will visualize solutions to three problems. The fibonacci
sequence, the factorial function, and the Hanoi. The project will vizualize
solutions, implement them with and without memoization, and visualize a hash
map and call stack.
